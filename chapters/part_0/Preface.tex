This book is a practical field manual for designing industrial robot control systems. It is written for engineers who feel the gap between academic projects and the demands of the real world. We will take you on the full journey from concept to motion: from high-level systems engineering to the low-level details of the real-time (RT) control cycle, from transformation mathematics to modern C++ design patterns.

At the core of this book is the \textbf{Robot Development Toolkit (RDT)}, a complete, open-source controller for a six-axis manipulator. This is not just a theoretical example; it is a living project. We believe the best way to learn is by doing. Therefore, the full source code for the RDT controller and this book are available in public repositories, enabling you to not only study the theory, but also to compile, test, extend, and contribute.

This guide is intended for engineers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates who want to move beyond "demo projects" toward building reliable, scalable, and maintainable production-ready systems in robotics and industrial automation. Our goal is to give you the tools and the mindset to build systems that work not just on a demo stand, but for years on a factory floor.
