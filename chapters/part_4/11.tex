\chapter{Architectural Aspects of Testing and Debugging}
\label{chap:testing_debugging}

\begin{navigationbox}{In this chapter, you will learn:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How to design a system for \term{testability} from the ground up by applying principles like DI and abstraction.
        \item How to apply the \term{Testing Pyramid} strategy to RDT, with concrete examples of Unit, Integration, System (E2E), and HIL tests.
        \item The crucial role of \term{Test Doubles} like Stubs (\texttt{FakeMotionInterface}) and Mocks in enabling isolated testing.

    \end{itemize}
\end{navigationbox}

We have now conceptually designed and implemented a complex robotic control system. But how do we ensure it works correctly? How do we find and fix the inevitable bugs? In this chapter, we will explore how the RDT architecture facilitates testing and what approaches and tools are necessary for effective debugging. We will see that testing is not a separate phase but an integral part of the process of designing reliable systems. A well-designed architecture is, by definition, a \textbf{testable architecture}.

\section{Approaches to Testing: From Unit to Hardware-in-the-Loop}
\label{sec:testing_approaches}

There is no single "silver bullet" test that can verify the correctness of an entire complex system like a robot controller. Relying solely on manual, end-to-end testing (i.e., running a program on the real robot and visually checking if it behaves as expected) is slow, expensive, non-repeatable, and dangerous. It is a recipe for shipping unreliable software.

A robust testing strategy is always multi-layered. This concept is often visualized as the \textbf{Testing Pyramid}.

\subsection{The Testing Pyramid: A Multi-Layered Strategy}
\label{subsec:testing_pyramid}

The idea of the pyramid is simple: as we move up from the base, the scope of the tests increases, but their number, speed, and frequency should decrease.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Base (Unit Tests):} These are numerous, small, and extremely fast tests that verify a single component in complete isolation. They form the solid foundation of our quality assurance.
    \item \textbf{The Middle (Integration Tests):} Fewer in number, these tests verify that several components work correctly together.
    \item \textbf{The Top (System/End-to-End Tests):} Even fewer, these tests verify a complete user scenario through the entire software stack.
    \item \textbf{The Apex (Manual / HIL Tests):} The fewest and most expensive tests, often involving manual checks on the physical hardware or a sophisticated Hardware-in-the-Loop simulator.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Our RDT architecture, with its focus on dependency injection and abstract interfaces, is designed specifically to enable effective testing at every level of this pyramid. Let's examine each level in the context of our project.

\subsection*{Level 1: Unit Testing in RDT}
\label{subsec:unit_testing}


\textbf{Goal:} To verify the internal logic of a single class or function in \textbf{complete isolation} from its dependencies. \\
\textbf{Principle:} All external dependencies are replaced with "test doubles" like "stubs" or "mocks." Thanks to Dependency Injection, we can easily provide a test version of any required component. \\
\textbf{Example 1:} Testing a Stateless Utility (\hcode{FrameTransformer}).
    The \hcode{FrameTransformer} is a perfect candidate for unit testing. It's a static class with no dependencies. We can test its \hcode{combineTransforms()} method by providing it with two known input \hcode{Pose} objects, calculating the expected result manually (or with a trusted external tool), and then asserting that the method's output matches the expected result within a small tolerance for floating-point arithmetic. \\
\textbf{Example 2:} Testing a Stateful Component with Dependencies (\hcode{KdlKinematicSolver}).
    How do we test our kinematic solver in isolation from the complex KDL library it wraps? We use a "round-trip" test:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item We take a known set of joint angles (\(q_{start}\)).
            \item We call the Forward Kinematics method (\hcode{solveFK(q\_start)}) to get the resulting Cartesian pose (\(P_{result}\)).
            \item We then immediately use this pose as the target for the Inverse Kinematics method (\hcode{solveIK(P_{result}, ...)}).
            \item We assert that the resulting joint angles (\(q_{final}\)) are very close to our original angles (\(q_{start}\)).
        \end{enumerate}
        This verifies the internal consistency of our solver and its adapter logic for the KDL library, without needing any other system components.
\begin{tipbox}{Engineering Insight: Unit tests are the bedrock of Continuous Integration (CI)}
Unit tests are the bedrock of Continuous Integration (CI). They should be written for all critical algorithms and business logic. Being fast and self-contained, they can be run automatically on every code commit, providing immediate feedback to developers and preventing regressions from being introduced into the main codebase.
\end{tipbox}

% --- Continuation of 11.1 ---

\subsection*{Level 2: Integration Testing in RDT}
\label{subsec:integration_testing}

\textbf{Goal:} To verify that several components, when assembled, interact correctly according to their defined contracts (interfaces). We are no longer testing internal logic, but the communication between modules.\\
\textbf{Principle:} We use real implementations for the components being tested together, but replace their "external" dependencies with test doubles.\\
\textbf{Example:} Testing the RT-Core (\hcode{MotionManager} + \hcode{TrajectoryQueue} + HAL).\\
This is a critical integration test for our system. We want to verify that the \hcode{MotionManager}'s RT-thread can correctly pull commands from the \hcode{TrajectoryQueue} and pass them to the HAL, and that feedback flows correctly in the other direction.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Assembling the System Under Test (SUT):} In our test code, we instantiate a real \hcode{MotionManager} and its real \hcode{TrajectoryQueue} objects.
            \item \textbf{Replacing the Dependency:} Crucially, instead of a real hardware interface, we inject an instance of \textbf{\hcode{FakeMotionInterface}} into the \hcode{MotionManager}. This allows us to run the entire RT-core in complete isolation from any real hardware or network.
            \item \textbf{Simulating the NRT-Core:} The test code itself plays the role of the NRT-domain orchestrator. It runs in the main thread and pushes several \hcode{TrajectoryPoint} commands into the \hcode{MotionManager}'s command queue.
            \item \textbf{Simulating the Feedback Consumer:} In a separate test thread, we can poll the \hcode{MotionManager}'s feedback queue to verify that for every command we sent, a corresponding feedback packet is eventually produced.
            \item \textbf{Verification:} We assert that the queues' sizes change as expected, that the commands sent to the \hcode{FakeMotionInterface} match what we enqueued, and that the system correctly handles start, stop, and error conditions by calling the appropriate methods on the fake HAL.
        \end{enumerate}
\begin{tipbox}{Engineering Insight: The Power of HAL for Integration Testing}
The ability to perform this kind of integration test is a direct benefit of our HAL abstraction. We can thoroughly test the complex, multi-threaded logic of our entire real-time core without the cost, complexity, and non-determinism of dealing with physical hardware. This is an incredibly powerful technique.
\end{tipbox}


\subsection*{Level 3: System / End-to-End (E2E) Testing in RDT}
\label{subsec:system_testing}


\textbf{Goal:} To verify that the entire software stack, when fully assembled, correctly executes a complete user scenario from start to finish.\\
\textbf{Principle:} We instantiate almost all real components of our system, but typically replace the lowest-level hardware layer with a simulator. In essence, we are testing our complete \textit{Digital Twin}.\\
\textbf{Example:} Testing a "Teach and Run" Scenario.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Assembling the System:} The test instantiates all the major RDT components: \hcode{StateData}, \hcode{KdlKinematicSolver}, \hcode{TrajectoryPlanner}, \hcode{MotionManager},\\ \hcode{RobotController}, \hcode{Adapter}, and even the GUI panels. The only "fake" component is the \hcode{FakeMotionInterface} injected deep inside the stack.
            \item \textbf{Simulating User Actions:} The test code (or a dedicated test automation script) simulates user interaction with the GUI. It might programmatically "click" the Jog buttons, then the "Teach" button to create a few points, and finally the "Run Program" button.
            \item \textbf{Verification:} The test then observes the system's state through the \hcode{StateData} object or by monitoring the GUI's display model. It asserts that:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The robot in the 3D view moves along the expected trajectory.
                    \item The status displays (current position, mode) are updated correctly.
                    \item The program executes without errors.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
\begin{tipbox}{Engineering Insight: E2E Tests - Strengths and Strategy}
E2E tests are excellent for validating user stories and ensuring that all the integrated parts function together as a cohesive whole. They are, however, slower and more brittle than unit or integration tests. A good strategy is to have a comprehensive suite of unit/integration tests that cover all the corner cases, and a smaller set of "happy path" E2E tests to verify the main user scenarios.
\end{tipbox}


% --- Continuation of 11.1 ---

\subsection*{Level 4: Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing}
\label{subsec:hil_testing}

\textbf{Goal:} To test our final control software running on its target hardware, interacting with a high-fidelity simulation of the robot and its environment. This is the final validation step before testing on the actual, expensive physical robot.\\
\textbf{Principle (HIL):}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item We take our real RDT software running on the real target computer (e.g., an industrial PC).
            \item Instead of connecting its real-time network port (e.g., the EtherCAT master port) to real servo drives, we connect it to a specialized \textbf{HIL simulator}.
            \item The HIL simulator is a separate, powerful real-time computer that runs a highly accurate physical model of the robot's dynamics, the servo drives, and the encoders.
            \item When our controller sends a real EtherCAT frame commanding a motor to move, the HIL simulator receives this frame, calculates how the real motor \textit{would} have responded (including inertia, gravity, and even simulated failures), and sends back a realistic EtherCAT frame with the corresponding simulated encoder and sensor data.
        \end{enumerate}
\textbf{Example in RDT's Context:} We would run our full software stack using the \hcode{UDPMotion Interface} (or a future \hcode{EtherCATMotionInterface}). This interface would not be connected to a real robot, but to the HIL simulator's network port, which mimics the real robot's network behavior.\\
\begin{tipbox}{Engineering Insight: Why HIL is Crucial for Safety-Critical Systems} % Заголовок улучшен для формальности
HIL testing allows us to bridge the final gap between pure software simulation and physical reality. We can test:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real Network Conditions:} How does our RT-core handle real network latencies, jitter, or dropped packets from the fieldbus?
    \item \textbf{Driver-Level Bugs:} Does our concrete HAL implementation (\hcode{UDPMotionInterface}, etc.) correctly format and parse the frames for the specific protocol?
    \item \textbf{Fault Injection:} What happens if a drive suddenly fails? The HIL simulator can be instructed to stop responding or to send back an error code, allowing us to test our fault-tolerance mechanisms (Chapter~\ref{chap:fault_tolerance_safety}) in a controlled, repeatable way.
    \item \textbf{High-Fidelity Dynamics:} We can test how our control algorithms perform with a realistic physical model, including effects like gearbox elasticity and friction, without risking damage to the actual multi-million-dollar robot.
\end{itemize}
\end{tipbox}
\textbf{Cost and Complexity:} HIL simulators are complex and expensive pieces of equipment, often used in the aerospace, automotive, and high-end industrial automation sectors where the cost of failure on the real hardware is extremely high.


\subsection{Summary of the Testing Strategy}
\label{subsec:testing_strategy_summary}

A multi-layered testing strategy is the only reliable way to ensure the quality of a complex robotic control system. Our RDT architecture, founded on principles of modularity, abstraction, and dependency injection, is explicitly designed to be testable at each level of the pyramid.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit tests} verify our fundamental algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Integration tests} ensure our components communicate correctly.
    \item \textbf{System tests} on our Digital Twin verify that the entire software stack works as a cohesive whole.
    \item \textbf{HIL tests} provide the final, high-fidelity validation before deployment on physical hardware.
\end{itemize}
This defense-in-depth approach to quality assurance is what enables us to build systems that are not just functional, but demonstrably reliable and robust.

% Section 11.2: Debugging Tools and Approaches: Looking Under the Hood
% ===================================================================

\section{Debugging Tools and Approaches: Looking Under the Hood}
\label{sec:debugging_tools}

Even the most well-architected system with comprehensive tests will have bugs. Problems will inevitably arise, especially in a complex, multi-threaded system interacting with the real world. The ability to quickly find and fix these problems—the art of \textbf{debugging}—is a critical engineering skill. A good architecture must support this process, not hinder it.

There are three primary tools for "looking inside" a running system: logging, tracing, and breakpoints. Each has its own specific purpose, and using the right tool for the job is essential. Using the wrong tool, especially in a real-time context, can be ineffective or even dangerous.

\subsection{Logging: The System's "Black Box"}
\label{subsec:logging}

Logging is the process of recording key events, states, and errors to a persistent store (usually a text file) for later, offline analysis. When a system fails in the field, the log file is often the \textit{only} thing you have to understand what went wrong.

\paragraph{The Problem:} Why \hcode{printf} is Not Logging?
As we discussed conceptually in Chapter~\ref{chap:conceptual_architecture}, using simple console output like \hcode{printf} or \hcode{std::cout} for diagnostics in a professional system is a path to failure. It lacks three crucial elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Context:} A message "Error!" in the console tells you nothing about which module produced it, at what time, and under what circumstances.
    \item \textbf{Structure:} A stream of plain text messages cannot be easily filtered, aggregated, or analyzed automatically.
    \item \textbf{Safety:} Uncontrolled console output from a real-time loop can violate determinism and impact performance. Furthermore, in a multi-threaded application, messages from different threads will interleave chaotically, making the output unreadable.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{RDT's Solution:} A Centralized, Structured Logger.
A professional system requires a centralized logging service. In our RDT project, this is conceptually fulfilled by a static \hcode{Logger} class. Its key features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structured Output:} Every log message is not just text; it's a structured record containing, at a minimum:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A precise \textbf{timestamp}.
            \item A \textbf{severity level} (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
            \item A \textbf{source} (the name of the module or component that generated the event).
            \item The message \textbf{payload} itself.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thread Safety:} All logging operations are internally protected by a mutex to prevent interleaved messages from different threads.
    \item \textbf{Configurable Log Levels:} We can dynamically set the logging verbosity. In development, we might set the level to DEBUG to see everything. On a production system, we would set it to INFO or WARNING to only record important events and avoid filling up the disk.
    \item \textbf{Safe from RT-Domain:} As discussed in Chapter 7, direct logging from the RT-cycle is unsafe due to blocking file I/O. A truly hard real-time logger would use a lock-free queue to pass log messages from the RT-thread to a dedicated, low-priority NRT-thread that handles the actual file writing.
\end{itemize}

\begin{principlebox}{Logging is for Post-Mortem Analysis.}
    Logging is the primary tool for debugging issues that are not easily reproducible or that occur in the field. It is the system's "black box flight recorder." You use logs to answer the question: \textbf{"WHAT happened?"}
\end{principlebox}

\subsection{Tracing: The Microscope for the RT-Domain}
\label{subsec:tracing}

If logging is the system's high-level history book, tracing is its high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG). \textbf{Tracing} is the practice of recording a very large number of low-level events, primarily for performance analysis and verifying real-time behavior.

\paragraph{The Difference Between Logging and Tracing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Audience:} Logs are for humans. Traces are for machines (specialized analysis software).
    \item \textbf{Content:} Logs contain semantic information ("User loaded program X"). Traces contain low-level system events ("Thread 123 woke up," "Function foo() entered," "Mutex 0xABC locked").
    \item \textbf{Goal:} The goal of logging is to understand the application's logical flow. The goal of tracing is to understand its \textbf{temporal behavior}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{What We Trace in the RT-Domain}
In RDT's \hcode{MotionManager} and HAL, we would be interested in tracing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The exact start and end times of every \hcode{rt\_cycle\_tick} execution, to measure jitter.
    \item The moments when the RT-thread is preempted by the OS scheduler and when it resumes.
    \item The time taken to receive data from the HAL (\hcode{readState()}).
    \item The number of items in the \hcode{TrajectoryQueue} and \hcode{feedback\_queue\_} at various points.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tipbox}{Tracing Tools like LTTng.}
    How is this done without killing performance? We use highly efficient tracing frameworks like \textbf{LTTng (Linux Trace Toolkit next generation)} or \textbf{Perf} on Linux, or the \textbf{Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA)} on Windows.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The developer instruments the code with extremely lightweight "tracepoints." These are often just a few machine instructions that write an event ID and a high-resolution timestamp into a per-CPU, lock-free ring buffer in kernel memory. The overhead is measured in nanoseconds.
        \item During a test run, this buffer is continuously filled with millions of events.
        \item After the test, the contents of these kernel buffers are saved to a file.
        \item This trace file is then opened in a specialized analysis tool (like Trace Compass), which provides a powerful visualization of all events on a shared timeline.
    \end{enumerate}
    This is how you can definitively answer the question: \textbf{"WHY was my RT-cycle late by 200 microseconds?"} The trace might show that at that exact moment, a higher-priority network interrupt fired and the OS scheduler preempted your RT-thread for 190 microseconds. This level of insight is impossible to gain with traditional logging or debuggers.
\end{tipbox}
% --- Continuation of 11.2 ---

\subsection{Breakpoints: The Surgical Scalpel (To Be Used with Extreme Care)}
\label{subsec:breakpoints}

A \textbf{breakpoint} is the most powerful interactive debugging tool. It allows a developer to completely freeze the execution of a program at a specific line of code and inspect the entire system state: the values of all variables, the call stack, the contents of memory. It is a surgical scalpel for dissecting complex logic. However, its power comes with great danger, especially in a real-time, multi-threaded system.




\begin{dangerbox}{Categorical Prohibition: Do Not Set Breakpoints in Real-Time Code.}
    Placing a breakpoint inside the \hcode{MotionManager::tick()} method while it is connected to real (or even high-fidelity simulated) hardware is a guaranteed way to cause a major system fault. When you halt the RT-thread with a debugger, you are "stopping the world" from its perspective, but the physical world and other devices do not stop.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Watchdog Timeout:} The RT-thread, now frozen in the debugger, will fail to "pet" the system's watchdog timer. The watchdog will expire and trigger a system-wide fault.
        \item \textbf{Servo Drive Fault:} The servo drives will stop receiving new commands from the controller over the real-time network. After a few milliseconds of missing packets, their internal communication watchdog will time out. They will fault, disable their power stages, and apply their brakes.
        \item \textbf{Loss of State:} The entire system enters an inconsistent, unrecoverable error state. You might be able to see the variable you wanted to inspect, but you will have triggered a cascade of failures in the process.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{dangerbox}


\paragraph{Safe Application: Debugging the NRT-Domain}
In the NRT-domain components of RDT—such as the \hcode{TrajectoryPlanner}, the \hcode{RobotController}, and the \hcode{Adapter}—we can use breakpoints relatively safely.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scenario:} We want to debug a complex kinematic transformation. We can place a breakpoint inside a \hcode{TrajectoryPlanner} method.
    \item \textbf{System Behavior:} When the debugger hits the breakpoint, the NRT-planner thread freezes. The RT-core (\hcode{MotionManager}) is unaffected and continues its cycle. It will soon find its command queue empty and will safely enter its "Hold Position" mode, keeping the robot stationary. The GUI might become unresponsive because its polling mechanism in the Adapter might be part of the same NRT thread, but the critical RT-loop remains safe.
    \item \textbf{Benefit:} This allows the developer to step through the complex planning or state logic, inspect variables, and find the source of a logical error in a controlled manner.
\end{itemize}
Breakpoints are the right tool for answering the question: \textbf{"WHY did this variable get the wrong value at this exact moment?"}




\begin{tipbox}{Alternatives for Debugging Real-Time Code.}
    So how do you debug the RT-domain?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Use Tracing:} As described above, tracing is the primary tool for understanding temporal behavior and performance issues.
        \item \textbf{Use Lightweight Logging:} For simple state checking, use a highly optimized, real-time-safe logger that writes to a memory ring buffer, not to the console or a file.
        \item \textbf{Use Hardware Debuggers:} For the most difficult low-level bugs, engineers use specialized hardware debuggers (e.g., using a JTAG interface). These tools can read the state of the CPU's registers and memory without completely halting its execution, providing a less intrusive way to inspect the state of the RT-core.
    \end{itemize}
\end{tipbox}

\subsection{Summary: The Right Tool for the Right Domain}
\label{subsec:debugging_tool_summary}
Each debugging tool has its place in our architecture. A skilled engineer knows which one to choose.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logging} is our primary tool for post-mortem analysis of application logic, primarily in the \textbf{NRT-domain}. It answers "WHAT happened?"
    \item \textbf{Tracing} is our microscope for performance and determinism issues, primarily in the \textbf{RT-domain}. It answers "HOW, and exactly WHEN, did it happen?"
    \item \textbf{Breakpoints} are our powerful surgical tool for interactive debugging of complex algorithms, but they must be confined to the \textbf{NRT-domain}. They answer "WHY did this happen at this specific moment?"
\end{itemize}
Proper use of this toolkit allows for effective diagnostics and problem-solving at all levels of our complex control system architecture.

% Section 11.3: The Role of Test Doubles: `FakeMotionInterface` and Mock Objects
% ===================================================================

\section{The Role of Test Doubles: \hcode{FakeMotionInterface} and Mock Objects}
\label{sec:test_doubles}

In Section~\ref{sec:testing_approaches}, we established that a cornerstone of our testing strategy, especially for unit and integration tests, is the ability to test components in isolation. This is often impossible if a component has hard-coded dependencies on other complex parts of the system, like the GUI or the physical hardware communication layer. To break these dependencies during testing, we use a technique called \textbf{Test Doubles}.

A Test Double is an object that looks and acts like a real component (as it implements the same interface) but is actually a simplified version created specifically for testing purposes. Our RDT architecture relies heavily on two key types of test doubles to enable its multi-layered testing strategy.

\begin{tipbox}{Terminology of Test Doubles (Stubs vs. Mocks).}
    While often used interchangeably, there is a subtle philosophical difference between two common types of test doubles:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Stub:} A simple object that provides canned, pre-programmed responses to method calls. Its main purpose is to provide the necessary data to prevent the System Under Test (SUT) from crashing due to a null dependency. We typically don't verify interactions with a stub. Our \hcode{FakeMotionInterface} is, in essence, a sophisticated stub.
        \item \textbf{Mock:} A "smarter" object that is programmed with expectations. In addition to providing responses, it verifies that it is being called correctly by the SUT. At the end of a test, we might ask the mock object: "Was your \hcode{runProgram()} method called exactly once with these specific arguments?" A mock helps test the \textit{interaction} between objects.
    \end{itemize}
\end{tipbox}

\subsection{\hcode{FakeMotionInterface}: A Stub for the Entire Hardware Layer}
\label{subsec:fakemotioninterface_stub}

The \hcode{FakeMotionInterface} is arguably the most important test double in the entire RDT project. It is a concrete implementation of the \hcode{IMotionInterface} contract, just like \hcode{UDPMotionInterface}. However, instead of communicating with real hardware, it simulates the robot's behavior entirely in software.

\paragraph{How it Enables Testing}
By injecting an instance of \hcode{FakeMotionInterface} into our \hcode{MotionManager}, we effectively replace the entire physical world—servo drives, encoders, industrial network, and robot mechanics—with a single, predictable, in-memory object.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Integration Testing:} It allows us to test the entire RT-core (\hcode{MotionManager} + queues) in complete isolation. We can verify that the RT-thread correctly processes commands and generates feedback without the non-determinism of network latencies or the need for physical hardware.
    \item \textbf{For System (E2E) Testing:} It allows us to run the full software stack, from the GUI to the motion core, on a developer's laptop. The \hcode{Adapter} sends commands to the \hcode{RobotController}, which uses the \hcode{TrajectoryPlanner}, which fills the \hcode{TrajectoryQueue}, which is consumed by the \hcode{MotionManager}, which finally calls \hcode{sendCommand} on the \hcode{FakeMotionInterface}. The fake interface then updates its internal state, which is read back through the feedback path and eventually displayed in the GUI. We can test the entire command and feedback conveyor.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Important Distinction: Stub, Not a High-Fidelity Digital Twin}
It is crucial to understand that our \hcode{FakeMotionInterface} is a simple \textbf{kinematic stub}, not a high-fidelity Digital Twin.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What it does:} It simulates the robot's kinematics. When it receives a target joint position, it updates its internal state to that position, perhaps with a simple velocity profile to make the change non-instantaneous.
    \item \textbf{What it does NOT do:} It does not simulate the robot's dynamics (mass, inertia, gravity), friction, gearbox elasticity, motor torque limits, or any complex physical phenomena.
\end{itemize}
Its purpose is not to be a physically accurate simulation, but to provide a functionally correct and predictable "dummy" HAL that satisfies the \hcode{IMotionInterface} contract and allows the higher-level software layers to be tested. A true Digital Twin would be a much more complex implementation of \hcode{IMotionInterface}, incorporating a full physics engine. Our architecture allows for such a component to be seamlessly plugged in to replace the simpler fake.

\subsection{Mocking the GUI: Testing the Core without Qt}
\label{subsec:mocking_the_gui}

Just as we need to isolate the core from the hardware, we also need to isolate it from the GUI for effective testing. How can we test the \hcode{RobotController} or the \hcode{Adapter} without launching a full Qt application and programmatically clicking buttons? The answer is to use a \textbf{Mock Object} that pretends to be the GUI.

\paragraph{Conceptual Implementation of a \hcode{Mock\_Adapter}}
While our current tests might launch the full application, a more rigorous unit/integration test for the \hcode{RobotController} would involve creating a \hcode{Mock\_Adapter} object.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simulating User Actions:} The test code would call methods on the \hcode{Mock\_Adapter} that simulate user intent, e.g., \hcode{mock\_adapter->simulateJogButtonClick(...)}. Inside this method, the mock object would perform the same logic as the real adapter: read from \hcode{StateData} and call the appropriate method on the \hcode{RobotController}, such as \hcode{executeMotionToTarget()}.
    \item \textbf{Verifying Core Output:} The \hcode{Mock\_Adapter} would also conceptually connect to the core's state changes. The test could then query the mock object to verify that the core responded correctly. For example: \hcode{ASSERT\_TRUE(mock\_adapter->didReceivePose Update());}
\end{itemize}
This allows us to test the NRT-domain's logic and its interaction with the Adapter layer without any dependency on the Qt framework, making the tests much faster and more focused.

\subsection{The Architectural Payoff: Testability by Design}
\label{subsec:test_double_payoff}

The ability to write and use these test doubles is not an accident; it is a direct result of our architectural choices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Programming to Interfaces:} Because \hcode{MotionManager} depends on the abstract \hcode{IMotionInterface}, we can provide any class that fulfills this contract, be it the real HAL or our fake one.
    \item \textbf{Dependency Injection:} Because dependencies are injected from the outside, the test code can easily construct a component with a mock or stubbed dependency.
\end{itemize}

Test doubles are not "hacks" or "workarounds." They are a fundamental and powerful technique for building clean, decoupled, and, most importantly, highly testable architectures. They allow us to dismantle our complex system and verify each part in isolation, which is the only way to build confidence in the system as a whole.
